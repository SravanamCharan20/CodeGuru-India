```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Repository Upload Fails
- Check URL format: `https://github.com/user/repo`
- Verify repository is public
- Check file size (max 100MB)
- Ensure repository contains supported code files

### No Files Selected
- Try broader learning goal
- Check if repository has supported languages
- Review suggested alternative intents

### Analysis Takes Too Long
- Repository might be very large
- Try focusing on specific folders
- Check network connection for GitHub uploads

### Artifacts Not Generated
- Check if analysis completed successfully
- Verify repository has analyzable code
- Try with a different repository
